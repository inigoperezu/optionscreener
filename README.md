##Â 1.- Dashboard with Slider
This is the main app in which i am working. IS a complete dashboard able to show the data of the main option strategies and compute which is the best combination.

## 2.- Dashboard. PY
This is the base of the dashboard. it works as an individual dashboard

## 3.- PMCC ipynb
This is the jupyter workboo in which i work and program by modules. Once i check calculations etc are correct i transpose it to the main code, so that i divide all the tasks in to small and easy to create pieces that compose later the big picture.
